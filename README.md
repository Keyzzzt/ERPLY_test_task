# Erply test task.

### `run yarn to instal packages`
### `yarn start - to run app in the development mode`
### `yarn test - to run tests`

## Notes
### `Why I didn't use Redux Toolkit`
I used to write applications without Redux Toolkit, which saved me time while working on this app.
Even though I understand, that this is something that I need to update in my stack.

### `Not best design`
I was focused on application logic, but let me know if you want me to refactor it so that it would look nicer.
